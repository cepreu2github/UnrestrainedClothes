[h1][b]OVERVIEW[/b][/h1]
Was you ever confused that armor customization from Anarchy’s Children (like 
present at picture) Firaxis calls Kevlar Armor? If you want to play with those
customizations, but don't want to throw away realism, this is mod for you.
It adds new armor called "Unrestrained Clothes" to which such customizations can be 
applied. From its name obvious that actually it is not armor. It just convenient
clothes. So it provides debuff to Dodge (better chance to crit wearer 
of this armor) indicating that there no protection, but instead
provides defense, mobility bonus and ability to climb buildings without a ladder.
It means that this clothes does not restrain movement, so wearer can realize all
his acrobatic potential.

[h1][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/h1]
This mod should be compatible with almost everything 
and you should be able to add/remove it mid campaign without any problem.
No class override.
